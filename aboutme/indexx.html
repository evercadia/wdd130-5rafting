        <h2> Hello, my name in Nathan Jellerson</h2>
        <h3> I prefer to be called by Nate, or Zene</h3>
        <p>I currently live in Virginia Beach and have since 2005. I am married with one daughter, her name is Mebe.
            My wife is from Peru. We have boon married for 11 years. I have worked for Fedex for 17 years, 
            I am part time now to watch Mebe after she gets home 
            from school. </p> 
        <p> I have written and published a book on Amazon called EVERCADIA. I love to write, it helps my creativity expand.
            I am currently taking courses in web design/ &(programming (?).. We will see how the programming goes. I am a little slow to catch on,
            but once i understand and see the patterns, I am able to axcel greatly. I will work hard in this course and never give up.
            I hope that by having a greater understanding in web design, that I might be able to push my book series further.
            I have been a member of the church since 1996 and served a mission in Ventura california.
            I look forward to meeting with you all and designing pages together. </p>
